I want you to analyze the following text the correspond to the description of the vulnerability <cve-id>,  <cve-description>, and extract the name of the software or hardware and the versions that are vulnerable to this cve . 
The idea of this request is to compare this results to a software and check if it is vulnerable or not. Because of that the result of this request must be a json with the following fields: 
"CVE_ID" field is the cve identifier, vulnerable_versions  this field is an array of jsons, each json that is part of this array is going to contain the following fields,  
"module" this field is the name of the software or hardware, "versions" this field needs to be a string and it is going to contain all the vulnerable versions for the software or hardware in question and can only contain the versions numbers and symbols as "<", ">" , "=" "<=", ">=" 
this symbols are used to represent the versions that are vulnerable and always needs to be a blank space between the comparison symmbol and the version.  The result needs to be a json file that contains all the requested information. The answer to this request must be a json format file!!

The example of the JSON output is the following:

{
            "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-0001",
            "vulnerable_versions": [
                {
                    "module": "Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows",
                    "versions": "<=2.7"
                }
            ]
        }


Module value needs to be strictly a string
versions value needs to be strictly a string


in case there are multiple modules you just add a new element to vulnerable versiones array,
like this:

{
            "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-0199",
            "vulnerable_versions": [
                {
                    "module": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows",
                    "versions": "< 510.39"
                },
                {
                    "module": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux",
                    "versions": "< 510.39"
                }
            ]
        }
