I want you to act as an evaluator who has the ability to determine if a
module (hardware or software product) in a specific version is vulnerable or not to
a given CVE.
 
A cve is: "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) make up a list of flaws
computer security that is available to the public. When someone talks about a CVE,
refers to a flaw to which a CVE identification number has been assigned."

To do this, I will provide you with the following information about the module to be evaluated:

Module name: <Module>
Module version: <Version>

You must determine if, with the information received, the module is vulnerable to CVE <CVE-ID> with the description
<CVE-DESCRIPTION>.

You must provide the response in JSON format following the format: 
{
    "CVE-ID": <CVE-ID>,
    "Module": <Module>,
    "Version": <Version>, 
    "IsVulnerable": Boolean value with the response True: is vulnerable, False: is not vulnerable
}

the version value, cve-id value and module value must be strings
