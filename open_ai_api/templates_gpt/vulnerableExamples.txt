I have an experiment that I want to carry out, for this I need to obtain a module and its specific version that is vulnerable to a CVE. The example of the result is in the following json. It is important to clarify that I only need one module and one version so you don't have to put more than that. The version must only have one, this field must not be an array, it must be a string with a single version, examples like 3.4, 2.1 are not necessary, we only use 3.4 or 2.1 for example

{
	“CVE-ID”: id del cve
	“isVulnerable”: {“Module: ”, “Version:”}
}

This json indicates the id of each cve as well as at least one module and a version belonging to that module that makes it vulnerable to that specific cve. I have a list of jsons like the one I presented to you previously.

To generate this list you will be based on the content of the following list of which the CVE-ID and the description are the only relevant fields

<cve-id> , <cve-description>
