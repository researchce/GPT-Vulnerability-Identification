CVE-2023-39347,Candidate,"Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to update pod labels can cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies. This issue arises due to the fact that on pod update, Cilium incorrectly uses user-provided pod labels to select the policies which apply to the workload in question. This can affect Cilium network policies that use the namespace, service account or cluster constructs to restrict traffic, Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace labels to select the Pod and Kubernetes network policies. Non-existent construct names can be provided, which bypass all network policies applicable to the construct. For example, providing a pod with a non-existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying to the pod in question. This attack requires the attacker to have Kubernetes API Server access, as described in the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in: Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14.

CVE-2023-24827,Candidate,syft is a a CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`) during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.,MISC:https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3   |   URL:https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3   |   MISC:https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956   |   URL:https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956,Assigned (20230130),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-45821,Candidate,"Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding, installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a security researcher identified a bug in which the `registryIsDockerHub` function was only checking that the registry domain had the `docker.io` suffix. Artifact Hub allows providing some Docker credentials that are used to increase the rate limit applied when interacting with the Docker Hub registry API to read publicly available content. Due to the incorrect check described above, it'd be possible to hijack those credentials by purchasing a domain which ends with `docker.io` and deploying a fake OCI registry on it. <https://artifacthub.io/> uses some credentials that only have permissions to read public content available in the Docker Hub. However, even though credentials for private repositories (disabled on `artifacthub.io`) are handled in a different way, other Artifact Hub deployments could have been using them for a different purpose.

CVE-2023-24814,Candidate,"TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework released under the GNU General Public License. In affected versions the TYPO3 core component `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()` uses the unfiltered server environment variable `PATH_INFO`, which allows attackers to inject malicious content. In combination with the TypoScript setting `config.absRefPrefix=auto`, attackers can inject malicious HTML code to pages that have not been rendered and cached, yet. As a result, injected values would be cached and delivered to other website visitors (persisted cross-site scripting). Individual code which relies on the resolved value of `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv('SCRIPT_NAME')` and corresponding usages (as shown below) are vulnerable as well. Additional investigations confirmed that at least Apache web server deployments using CGI (FPM, FCGI/FastCGI, and similar) are affected. However, there still might be the risk that other scenarios like nginx, IIS, or Apache/mod_php are vulnerable. The usage of server environment variable `PATH_INFO` has been removed from corresponding processings in `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()`. Besides that, the public property `TypoScriptFrontendController::$absRefPrefix` is encoded for both being used as a URI component and for being used as a prefix in an HTML context. This mitigates the cross-site scripting vulnerability. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.51 ELTS, 9.5.40 ELTS, 10.4.35 LTS, 11.5.23 LTS and 12.2.0 which fix this problem. For users who are unable to patch in a timely manner the TypoScript setting `config.absRefPrefix` should at least be set to a static path value, instead of using auto - e.g. `config.absRefPrefix=/`. This workaround **does not fix all aspects of the vulnerability**, and is just considered to be an intermediate mitigation to the most prominent manifestation.",MISC:https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/main/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#absrefprefix   |   URL:https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/main/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#absrefprefix   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/GeneralUtility.php#L2481-L2484   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/GeneralUtility.php#L2481-L2484   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Controller/TypoScriptFrontendController.php#L2547-L2549   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Controller/TypoScriptFrontendController.php#L2547-L2549   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/0005a6fd86ab97eff8bf2e3a5828bf0e7cb6263a   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/0005a6fd86ab97eff8bf2e3a5828bf0e7cb6263a   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-r4f8-f93x-5qh3   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-r4f8-f93x-5qh3   |   MISC:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-001   |   URL:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-001   |   MISC:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2023-001   |   URL:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2023-001,Assigned (20230130),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-37479,Candidate,"Open Enclave is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing applications that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments, also known as Enclaves. There are two issues that are mitigated in version 0.19.3. First, Open Enclave SDK does not properly sanitize the `MXCSR` register on enclave entry. This makes applications vulnerable to MXCSR Configuration Dependent Timing (MCDT) attacks, where incorrect `MXCSR` values can impact instruction retirement by at most one cycle, depending on the (secret) data operand value. Please find more details in the guidance from Intel in the references. Second, Open Enclave SDK does not sanitize x86's alignment check flag `RFLAGS.AC` on enclave entry. This opens up the possibility for a side-channel attacker to be notified for every unaligned memory access performed by the enclave.

CVE-2023-48240,Candidate,"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The rendered diff in XWiki embeds images to be able to compare the contents and not display a difference for an actually unchanged image. For this, XWiki requests all embedded images on the server side. These requests are also sent for images from other domains and include all cookies that were sent in the original request to ensure that images with restricted view right can be compared. Starting in version 11.10.1 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6, this allows an attacker to steal login and session cookies that allow impersonating the current user who views the diff. The attack can be triggered with an image that references the rendered diff, thus making it easy to trigger. Apart from stealing login cookies, this also allows server-side request forgery (the result of any successful request is returned in the image's source) and viewing protected content as once a resource is cached, it is returned for all users. As only successful requests are cached, the cache will be filled by the first user who is allowed to access the resource. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.1 and 15.6. The rendered diff now only downloads images from trusted domains. Further, cookies are only sent when the image's domain is the same the requested domain. The cache has been changed to be specific for each user. As a workaround, the image embedding feature can be disabled by deleting `xwiki-platform-diff-xml-<version>.jar` in `WEB-INF/lib/`.",MISC:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/bff0203e739b6e3eb90af5736f04278c73c2a8bb   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/bff0203e739b6e3eb90af5736f04278c73c2a8bb   |   MISC:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7rfg-6273-f5wp   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7rfg-6273-f5wp   |   MISC:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20818   |   URL:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20818,Assigned (20231113),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-38491,Candidate,"Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to upload an arbitrary file to the content folder. Kirby sites are not affected if they don't allow file uploads for untrusted users or visitors or if the file extensions of uploaded files are limited to a fixed safe list. The attack requires user interaction by another user or visitor and cannot be automated. An editor with write access to the Kirby Panel could upload a file with an unknown file extension like `.xyz` that contains HTML code including harmful content like `<script>` tags. The direct link to that file could be sent to other users or visitors of the site. If the victim opened that link in a browser where they are logged in to Kirby and the file had not been opened by anyone since the upload, Kirby would not be able to send the correct MIME content type, instead falling back to `text/html`. The browser would then run the script, which could for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim. The issue was caused by the underlying `Kirby\Http\Response::file()` method, which didn't have an explicit fallback if the MIME type could not be determined from the file extension. If you use this method in site or plugin code, these uses may be affected by the same vulnerability. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have fixed the affected method to use a fallback MIME type of `text/plain` and set the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header if the MIME type of the file is unknown.",MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/2f06ba1c026bc91cb0702bc16b7d505642536d15   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/2f06ba1c026bc91cb0702bc16b7d505642536d15   |   MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3   |   MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3   |   MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2   |   MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1   |   MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6   |   MISC:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9   |   URL:https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9,Assigned (20230718),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-6245,Candidate,"The Candid library causes a Denial of Service while parsing a specially crafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example, if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra field required by the type. The problem with the type empty is that the candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding loop. Canisters using affected versions of candid are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to run indefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximum instruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload will result in degraded performance of the canister.

CVE-2023-41337,Candidate,"h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. In version 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when h2o is configured to listen to multiple addresses or ports with each of them using different backend servers managed by multiple entities, a malicious backend entity that also has the opportunity to observe or inject packets exchanged between the client and h2o may misdirect HTTPS requests going to other backends and observe the contents of that HTTPS request being sent. The attack involves a victim client trying to resume a TLS connection and an attacker redirecting the packets to a different address or port than that intended by the client. The attacker must already have been configured by the administrator of h2o to act as a backend to one of the addresses or ports that the h2o instance listens to. Session IDs and tickets generated by h2o are not bound to information specific to the server address, port, or the X.509 certificate, and therefore it is possible for an attacker to force the victim connection to wrongfully resume against a different server address or port on which the same h2o instance is listening. Once a TLS session is misdirected to resume to a server address / port that is configured to use an attacker-controlled server as the backend, depending on the configuration, HTTPS requests from the victim client may be forwarded to the attacker's server. An H2O instance is vulnerable to this attack only if the instance is configured to listen to different addresses or ports using the listen directive at the host level and the instance is configured to connect to backend servers managed by multiple entities. A patch is available at commit 35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab. As a workaround, one may stop using using host-level listen directives in favor of global-level ones.",MISC:https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab   |   URL:https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab   |   MISC:https://github.com/h2o/h2o/security/advisories/GHSA-5v5r-rghf-rm6q   |   URL:https://github.com/h2o/h2o/security/advisories/GHSA-5v5r-rghf-rm6q,Assigned (20230828),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-40027,Candidate,"Keystone is an open source headless CMS for Node.js &#8212; built with GraphQL and React. When `ui.isAccessAllowed` is set as `undefined`, the `adminMeta` GraphQL query is publicly accessible (no session required). This is different to the behaviour of the default AdminUI middleware, which by default will only be publicly accessible (no session required) if a `session` strategy is not defined. This vulnerability does not affect developers using the `@keystone-6/auth` package, or any users that have written their own `ui.isAccessAllowed` (that is to say, `isAccessAllowed` is not `undefined`). This vulnerability does affect users who believed that their `session` strategy will, by default, enforce that `adminMeta` is inaccessible by the public in accordance with that strategy; akin to the behaviour of the AdminUI middleware.

CVE-2023-28102,Candidate,"discordrb is an implementation of the Discord API using Ruby. In discordrb before commit `91e13043ffa` the `encoder.rb` file unsafely constructs a shell string using the file parameter, which can potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command injection. The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However, if unsafe input reaches the library method, then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system access.

CVE-2023-34095,Candidate,"cpdb-libs provides frontend and backend libraries for the Common Printing Dialog Backends (CPDB) project. In versions 1.0 through 2.0b4, cpdb-libs is vulnerable to buffer overflows via improper use of `scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to parse command lines and configuration files, dropping the read string components into fixed-length buffers, but does not limit the length of the strings to be read by `fscanf()` and `scanf()` causing buffer overflows when a string is longer than 1023 characters. A patch for this issue is available at commit f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7.

CVE-2023-26031,Candidate,"Relative library resolution in linux container-executor binary in Apache Hadoop 3.3.1-3.3.4 on Linux allows local user to gain root privileges. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, this MAY permit remote users to gain root privileges. Hadoop 3.3.0 updated the "" YARN Secure Containers https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SecureContainer.html "" to add a feature for executing user-submitted applications in isolated linux containers. The native binary HADOOP_HOME/bin/container-executor is used to launch these containers; it must be owned by root and have the suid bit set in order for the YARN processes to run the containers as the specific users submitting the jobs. The patch "" YARN-10495 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495 . make the rpath of container-executor configurable"" modified the library loading path for loading .so files from ""$ORIGIN/"" to """"$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/"". This is the a path through which libcrypto.so is located. Thus it is is possible for a user with reduced privileges to install a malicious libcrypto library into a path to which they have write access, invoke the container-executor command, and have their modified library executed as root. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, and these users' submitted job are executed in the physical host, rather than a container, then the CVE permits remote users to gain root privileges. The fix for the vulnerability is to revert the change, which is done in YARN-11441 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-11441 , ""Revert YARN-10495"". This patch is in hadoop-3.3.5.

CVE-2023-27488,Candidate,"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, escalation of privileges is possible when `failure_mode_allow: true` is configured for `ext_authz` filter. For affected components that are used for logging and/or visibility, requests may not be logged by the receiving service. When Envoy was configured to use ext_authz, ext_proc, tap, ratelimit filters, and grpc access log service and an http header with non-UTF-8 data was received, Envoy would generate an invalid protobuf message and send it to the configured service. The receiving service would typically generate an error when decoding the protobuf message. For ext_authz that was configured with ``failure_mode_allow: true``, the request would have been allowed in this case. For the other services, this could have resulted in other unforeseen errors such as a lack of visibility into requests. As of versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy by default sanitizes the values sent in gRPC service calls to be valid UTF-8, replacing data that is not valid UTF-8 with a `!` character. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard `envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings` to false.

CVE-2023-22497,Candidate,"Netdata is an open source option for real-time infrastructure monitoring and troubleshooting. Each Netdata Agent has an automatically generated MACHINE GUID. It is generated when the agent first starts and it is saved to disk, so that it will persist across restarts and reboots. Anyone who has access to a Netdata Agent has access to its MACHINE_GUID. Streaming is a feature that allows a Netdata Agent to act as parent for other Netdata Agents (children), offloading children from various functions (increased data retention, ML, health monitoring, etc) that can now be handled by the parent Agent. Configuration is done via `stream.conf`. On the parent side, users configure in `stream.conf` an API key (any random UUID can do) to provide common configuration for all children using this API key and per MACHINE GUID configuration to customize the configuration for each child. The way this was implemented, allowed an attacker to use a valid MACHINE_GUID as an API key. This affects all users who expose their Netdata Agents (children) to non-trusted users and they also expose to the same users Netdata Agent parents that aggregate data from all these children. The problem has been fixed in: Netdata agent v1.37 (stable) and Netdata agent v1.36.0-409 (nightly). As a workaround, do not enable streaming by default. If you have previously enabled this, it can be disabled. Limiting access to the port on the recipient Agent to trusted child connections may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.",MISC:https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.37.0   |   URL:https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.37.0   |   MISC:https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-jx85-39cw-66f2   |   URL:https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-jx85-39cw-66f2,Assigned (20221229),None (candidate not yet proposed),

This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.1 and 15.0 RC1 by not granting the space admin right if the user doesn't have script right on the space where the app is created. Error message are displayed to warn the user that the app will be broken in this case.

CVE-2023-41058,Candidate,Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers.,MISC:https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security   |   URL:https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security   |   MISC:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/be4c7e23c63a2fb690685665cebed0de26be05c5   |   URL:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/be4c7e23c63a2fb690685665cebed0de26be05c5   |   MISC:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/5.5.5   |   URL:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/5.5.5   |   MISC:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/6.2.2   |   URL:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/6.2.2   |   MISC:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-fcv6-fg5r-jm9q   |   URL:https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-fcv6-fg5r-jm9q,Assigned (20230822),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-35934,Candidate,"yt-dlp is a command-line program to download videos from video sites. During file downloads, yt-dlp or the external downloaders that yt-dlp employs may leak cookies on HTTP redirects to a different host, or leak them when the host for download fragments differs from their parent manifest's host. This vulnerable behavior is present in yt-dlp prior to 2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519. All native and external downloaders are affected, except for `curl` and `httpie` (version 3.1.0 or later). At the file download stage, all cookies are passed by yt-dlp to the file downloader as a `Cookie` header, thereby losing their scope. This also occurs in yt-dlp's info JSON output, which may be used by external tools. As a result, the downloader or external tool may indiscriminately send cookies with requests to domains or paths for which the cookies are not scoped. yt-dlp version 2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519 fix this issue by removing the `Cookie` header upon HTTP redirects; having native downloaders calculate the `Cookie` header from the cookiejar, utilizing external downloaders' built-in support for cookies instead of passing them as header arguments, disabling HTTP redirectiong if the external downloader does not have proper cookie support, processing cookies passed as HTTP headers to limit their scope, and having a separate field for cookies in the info dict storing more information about scoping Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Avoid using cookies and user authentication methods. While extractors may set custom cookies, these usually do not contain sensitive information. Alternatively, avoid using `--load-info-json`. Or, if authentication is a must: verify the integrity of download links from unknown sources in browser (including redirects) before passing them to yt-dlp; use `curl` as external downloader, since it is not impacted; and/or avoid fragmented formats such as HLS/m3u8, DASH/mpd and ISM.",FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-1f11546a48   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M7E7CQ5S5KMZHAMCNU7V7KYNBVCPLBHG/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-5435c10480   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HEOKCGVONGHR2SYUIXU33A4MKXZBDP6L/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-79e2b35ba6   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5X6YT6AQE5FHM5VTQLKKJXSYBLLJF26W/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-9f3938e10d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IM44RJL2MR2WG3ZY354C5IUEEZUJGEVA/   |   MISC:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases/tag/2023.07.06.185519   |   URL:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases/tag/2023.07.06.185519   |   MISC:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/1ceb657bdd254ad961489e5060f2ccc7d556b729   |   URL:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/1ceb657bdd254ad961489e5060f2ccc7d556b729   |   MISC:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/3121512228487c9c690d3d39bfd2579addf96e07   |   URL:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/3121512228487c9c690d3d39bfd2579addf96e07   |   MISC:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f8b4bcc0a791274223723488bfbfc23ea3276641   |   URL:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f8b4bcc0a791274223723488bfbfc23ea3276641   |   MISC:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.07.06   |   URL:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.07.06   |   MISC:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-v8mc-9377-rwjj   |   URL:https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-v8mc-9377-rwjj,Assigned (20230620),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-34252,Candidate,"Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.42, there is a logic flaw in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function whereby validation against a denylist of unsafe functions is only performed when the argument passed to filter is a string. However, passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation check to be skipped. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. The vulnerability can be found in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function declared in `/system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php`. Version 1.7.42 contains a patch for this issue.

CVE-2023-41330,Candidate,"knplabs/knp-snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or PDF generation from a url or a html page. ## Issue On March 17th the vulnerability CVE-2023-28115 was disclosed, allowing an attacker to gain remote code execution through PHAR deserialization. Version 1.4.2 added a check `if (\strpos($filename, 'phar://') === 0)` in the `prepareOutput` function to resolve this CVE, however if the user is able to control the second parameter of the `generateFromHtml()` function of Snappy, it will then be passed as the `$filename` parameter in the `prepareOutput()` function. In the original vulnerability, a file name with a `phar://` wrapper could be sent to the `fileExists()` function, equivalent to the `file_exists()` PHP function. This allowed users to trigger a deserialization on arbitrary PHAR files. To fix this issue, the string is now passed to the `strpos()` function and if it starts with `phar://`, an exception is raised. However, PHP wrappers being case insensitive, this patch can be bypassed using `PHAR://` instead of `phar://`. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code and accessing the underlying filesystem. The attacker must be able to upload a file and the server must be running a PHP version prior to 8. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3b742d61a` which has been included in version 1.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted users may submit data to the `AbstractGenerator->generate(...)` function.",MISC:https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/commit/d3b742d61a68bf93866032c2c0a7f1486128b67e   |   URL:https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/commit/d3b742d61a68bf93866032c2c0a7f1486128b67e   |   MISC:https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-92rv-4j2h-8mjj   |   URL:https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-92rv-4j2h-8mjj   |   MISC:https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc   |   URL:https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc,Assigned (20230828),None (candidate not yet proposed),
CVE-2023-22489,Candidate,"Flarum is a discussion platform for websites. If the first post of a discussion is permanently deleted but the discussion stays visible, any actor who can view the discussion is able to create a new reply via the REST API, no matter the reply permission or lock status. This includes users that don't have a validated email. Guests cannot successfully create a reply because the API will fail with a 500 error when the user ID 0 is inserted into the database. This happens because when the first post of a discussion is permanently deleted, the `first_post_id` attribute of the discussion becomes `null` which causes access control to be skipped for all new replies. Flarum automatically makes discussions with zero comments invisible so an additional condition for this vulnerability is that the discussion must have at least one approved reply so that `discussions.comment_count` is still above zero after the post deletion. This can open the discussion to uncontrolled spam or just unintentional replies if users still had their tab open before the vulnerable discussion was locked and then post a reply when they shouldn't be able to. In combination with the email notification settings, this could also be used as a way to send unsolicited emails. Versions between `v1.3.0` and `v1.6.3` are impacted.

A vulnerability impacts GitHub workflows using the Gradle Build Action prior to version 2.4.2 that have executed the Gradle Build Tool with the configuration cache enabled, potentially exposing secrets configured for the repository. Secrets configured for GitHub Actions are normally passed to the Gradle Build Tool via environment variables. Due to the way that the Gradle Build Tool records these environment variables, they may be persisted into an entry in the GitHub Actions cache. This data stored in the GitHub Actions cache can be read by a GitHub Actions workflow running in an untrusted context, such as that running for a Pull Request submitted by a developer via a repository fork. This vulnerability was discovered internally through code review, and we have not seen any evidence of it being exploited in the wild. However, in addition to upgrading the Gradle Build Action, affected users should delete any potentially vulnerable cache entries and may choose to rotate any potentially affected secrets. Gradle Build Action v2.4.2 and newer no longer saves this sensitive data for later use, preventing ongoing leakage of secrets via the GitHub Actions Cache. While upgrading to the latest version of the Gradle Build Action will prevent leakage of secrets going forward, additional actions may be required due to current or previous GitHub Actions Cache entries containing this information. Current cache entries will remain vulnerable until they are forcibly deleted or they expire naturally after 7 days of not being used. Potentially vulnerable entries can be easily identified in the GitHub UI by searching for a cache entry with key matching `configuration-cache-*`. The maintainers recommend that users of the Gradle Build Action inspect their list of cache entries and manually delete any that match this pattern. While maintainers have not seen any evidence of this vulnerability being exploited, they recommend cycling any repository secrets if you cannot be certain that these have not been compromised. Compromise could occur if a user runs a GitHub Actions workflow for a pull request attempting to exploit this data. Warning signs to look for in a pull request include: - Making changes to GitHub Actions workflow files in a way that may attempt to read/extract data from the Gradle User Home or `<project-root>/.gradle` directories. - Making changes to Gradle build files or other executable files that may be invoked by a GitHub Actions workflow, in a way that may attempt to read/extract information from these locations. Some workarounds to limit the impact of this vulnerability are available: - If the Gradle project does not opt-in to using the configuration cache, then it is not vulnerable. - If the Gradle project does opt-in to using the configuration-cache by default, then the `--no-configuration-cache` command-line argument can be used to disable this feature in a GitHub Actions workflow. In any case, we recommend that users carefully inspect any pull request before approving the execution of GitHub Actions workflows. It may be prudent to require approval for all PRs from external contributors.",MISC:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/releases/tag/v2.4.2   |   URL:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/releases/tag/v2.4.2   |   MISC:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/security/advisories/GHSA-h3qr-39j9-4r5v   |   URL:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action/security/advisories/GHSA-h3qr-39j9-4r5v,Assigned (20230418),None (candidate not yet proposed),

Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the block location for that XBlock. An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated line item. The LTI tool may submit any value for the resource_link_id field, allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform. The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock grades. This issue is patched in 7.2.2.

CVE-2023-34459,Candidate,"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves. A contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree. A contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe. The problem has been patched in version 4.9.2. Some workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves.",MISC:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/4d2383e17186be3e8ccf5a442e9686ecc7de1c55   |   URL:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/4d2383e17186be3e8ccf5a442e9686ecc7de1c55   |   MISC:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.2   |   URL:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.2   |   MISC:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wprv-93r4-jj2p   |   URL:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wprv-93r4-jj2p,Assigned (20230606),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-28857,Candidate,"Apereo CAS is an open source multilingual single sign-on solution for the web. Apereo CAS can be configured to use authentication based on client X509 certificates. These certificates can be provided via TLS handshake or a special HTTP header, such as &#8220;ssl_client_cert&#8221;. When checking the validity of the provided client certificate, X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler performs check that this certificate is not revoked. To do so, it fetches URLs provided in the &#8220;CRL Distribution Points&#8221; extension of the certificate, which are taken from the certificate itself and therefore can be controlled by a malicious user. If the CAS server is configured to use an LDAP server for x509 authentication with a password, for example by setting a &#8220;cas.authn.x509.ldap.ldap-url&#8221; and &#8220;cas.authn.x509.ldap.bind-credential&#8221; properties, X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler fetches revocation URLs from the certificate, which can be LDAP urls. When making requests to this LDAP urls, Apereo CAS uses the same password as for initially configured LDAP server, which can lead to a password leak.

CVE-2023-43633,Candidate,"On boot, the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of &#8220;/config/GlobalConfig/global.json&#8221;. If the file exists, it overrides the existing configuration on the device on boot. This allows an attacker to change the system&#8217;s configuration, which also includes some debug functions.

Other usages include unlocking the usb to enable the keyboard via the &#8220;debug.enable.usb&#8221; key, allowing VNC access via the &#8220;app.allow.vnc&#8221; key, and more. An attacker could easily enable these debug functionalities without triggering the &#8220;measured boot&#8221; mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking the device as &#8220;UUD&#8221; (&#8220;Unknown Update Detected&#8221;). This is because the &#8220;/config&#8221; partition is not protected by &#8220;measured boot&#8221;, it is mutable and it is not encrypted in any way. An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thereby not triggering the &#8220;measured boot&#8221; mechanism, and having full access to the vault.

CVE-2023-42449,Candidate,"Hydra is the two-layer scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to version 0.13.0, it is possible for a malicious head initializer to extract one or more PTs for the head they are initializing due to incorrect data validation logic in the head token minting policy which then results in an flawed check for burning the head ST in the `initial` validator. This is possible because it is not checked in `HeadTokens.hs` that the datums of the outputs at the `initial` validator are equal to the real head ID, and it is also not checked in the `off-chain code`. During the `Initial` state of the protocol, if the malicious initializer removes a PT from the Hydra scripts it becomes impossible for any other participant to reclaim any funds they have attempted to commit into the head, as to do so the Abort transaction must burn all the PTs for the head, but they cannot burn the PT which the attacker controls and so cannot satisfy this requirement. That means the initializer can lock the other participants committed funds forever or until they choose to return the PT (ransom). The malicious initializer can also use the PT to spoof that they have committed a particular TxO when progressing the head into the `Open` state. For example, they could say they committed a TxO residing at their address containing 100 ADA, but in fact this 100 ADA was not moved into the head, and thus in order for an other participant to perform the fanout they will be forced to pay the attacker the 100 ADA out of their own funds, as the fanout transaction must pay all the committed TxOs (even though the attacker did not really commit that TxO). They can do this by placing the PT in a UTxO with a well-formed `Commit` datum with whatever contents they like, then use this UTxO in the `collectCom` transaction. There may be other possible ways to abuse having control of a PT. Version 0.13.0 fixes this issue.",MISC:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/1e13b60a7b21c5ccd6c36e3cf220547f5d443cef/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct/Tx.hs#L645-L761   |   URL:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/1e13b60a7b21c5ccd6c36e3cf220547f5d443cef/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct/Tx.hs#L645-L761   |   MISC:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/1e13b60a7b21c5ccd6c36e3cf220547f5d443cef/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Initial.hs#L84-L91   |   URL:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/1e13b60a7b21c5ccd6c36e3cf220547f5d443cef/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Initial.hs#L84-L91   |   MISC:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---2023-10-03   |   URL:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---2023-10-03   |   MISC:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/HeadTokens.hs#L76-L136   |   URL:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/HeadTokens.hs#L76-L136   |   MISC:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-9m8q-7wxv-v65p   |   URL:https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-9m8q-7wxv-v65p,Assigned (20230908),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-47115,Candidate,"Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image. The file `users/functions.py` lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path. Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed. Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs.",MISC:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/views/#serving-files-in-development   |   URL:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/views/#serving-files-in-development   |   MISC:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/users/functions.py#L18-L49   |   URL:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/users/functions.py#L18-L49   |   MISC:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/users/urls.py#L25-L26   |   URL:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/users/urls.py#L25-L26   |   MISC:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/commit/a7a71e594f32ec4af8f3f800d5ccb8662e275da3   |   URL:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/commit/a7a71e594f32ec4af8f3f800d5ccb8662e275da3   |   MISC:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-q68h-xwq5-mm7x   |   URL:https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-q68h-xwq5-mm7x,Assigned (20231030),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-22482,Candidate,"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 and prior to 2.3.13, 2.4.19, 2.5.6, and 2.6.0-rc-3 are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens. OIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD. If Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD. This bug also increases the impact of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.0-rc3, 2.5.6, 2.4.19, and 2.3.13.

The issue was corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code.

Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts.

If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.

CVE-2023-22464,Candidate,"ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed path ""copyfrom paths"" during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format ""html""]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format ""html""][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else ""copyfrom path"" names will be doubly escaped.)",MISC:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/issues/311   |   URL:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/issues/311   |   MISC:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.1.30   |   URL:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.1.30   |   MISC:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.2.3   |   URL:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.2.3   |   MISC:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/security/advisories/GHSA-jvpj-293q-q53h   |   URL:https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/security/advisories/GHSA-jvpj-293q-q53h,Assigned (20221229),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-28840,Candidate,"Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*. Swarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code. The overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes. Encrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption. When setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN. Two iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded. The injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container&#8217;s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network. Patches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16. Some workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.",FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-9f5f1ef40a   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZTE4ITXXPIWZEQ4HYQCB6N6GZIMWXDAI/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-b9c1d0e4c5   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XNF4OLYZRQE75EB5TW5N42FSXHBXGWFE/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-cf3551046d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYZOKMMVX4SIEHPJW3SJUQGMO5YZCPHC/   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw,Assigned (20230324),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-26479,Candidate,"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.0, users with write rights can insert well-formed content that is not handled well by the parser. As a consequence, some pages becomes unusable, including the user index (if the page containing the faulty content is a user page) and the page index. Note that on the page, the normal UI is completely missing and it is not possible to open the editor directly to revert the change as the stack overflow is already triggered while getting the title of the document. This means that it is quite difficult to remove this content once inserted. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.6, and 14.9-rc-1. A temporary workaround to avoid Stack Overflow errors is to increase the memory allocated to the stack by using the `-Xss` JVM parameter (e.g., `-Xss32m`). This should allow the parser to pass and to fix the faulty content. The consequences for other aspects of the system (e.g., performance) are unknown, and this workaround should be only be used as a temporary solution. The workaround does not prevent the issue occurring again with other content. Consequently, it is strongly advised to upgrade to a version where the issue has been patched.",MISC:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e5b82cd98072464196a468b8f7fe6396dce142a7   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e5b82cd98072464196a468b8f7fe6396dce142a7   |   MISC:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-52vf-hvv3-98h7   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-52vf-hvv3-98h7   |   MISC:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19838   |   URL:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19838,Assigned (20230223),None (candidate not yet proposed),

CVE-2023-3817,Candidate,"Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the ""-check"" option.
